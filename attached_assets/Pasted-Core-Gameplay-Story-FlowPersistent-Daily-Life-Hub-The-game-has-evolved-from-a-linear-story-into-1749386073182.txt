This allows your story to progress without creative restrictions.Visual Consistency: The AI has a permanent, high-priority instruction to always depict Cha Hae-in with blonde hair and purple eyes, ensuring character consistency.Ken Burns Effect: Background images feature a slow, cinematic pan-and-zoom effect to create a more dynamic and engaging visual experience.
