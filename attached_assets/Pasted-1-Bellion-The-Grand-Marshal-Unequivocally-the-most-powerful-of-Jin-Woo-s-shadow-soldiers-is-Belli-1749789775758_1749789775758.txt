1. Bellion: The Grand Marshal

Unequivocally the most powerful of Jin-Woo's shadow soldiers is Bellion, the former servant of the first Shadow Monarch, Ashborn. Introduced late in the series, Bellion's power was immediately apparent, effortlessly overpowering Beru in a sparring match to claim the title of Grand Marshal. His strength is so immense that he is considered a peer to the Monarchs themselves. Wielding a unique, centipede-like sword that can extend and retract at will, Bellion possesses a level of swordsmanship and raw power that no other shadow soldier can match. His loyalty is absolute, having served the Shadow Monarch for eons, and he seamlessly transitions his allegiance to Jin-Woo.

2. Igris: The Blood-Red Commander

The ever-loyal and stoic Igris holds a special place in the hearts of many fans and a firm position as one of the most powerful shadows. Initially a formidable knight that Jin-Woo struggled to defeat in a job-change quest, Igris has consistently grown in power alongside his master. His unwavering loyalty and formidable combat prowess, characterized by his brilliant swordsmanship and devastating lightning attacks, have made him a cornerstone of the shadow army. While Beru might possess more raw ferocity, Igris's tactical mind and disciplined fighting style make him an invaluable commander on the battlefield.

3. Beru: The Ant King's Ferocity

The former Ant King of Jeju Island, Beru, is a force of nature reborn as one of Jin-Woo's most ferocious and powerful soldiers. Possessing incredible speed, overwhelming strength, and the ability to heal, Beru is a versatile and terrifying combatant. His insectoid nature grants him unique abilities, including a powerful healing shout and the capacity for flight. Beru's fierce loyalty and almost fanatical devotion to Jin-Woo are as potent as his combat skills, often providing moments of comic relief with his dramatic pronouncements. While he was surpassed by Bellion, his raw power and battlelust firmly place him in the top tier of the shadow army.

4. Kamish: The Dragon's Calamity (Temporary)

For a brief but impactful period, Jin-Woo commanded the shadow of Kamish, the catastrophic dragon that once laid waste to the United States and required a team of national-level hunters to subdue. Even as a shadow, Kamish's power was immense, capable of unleashing devastating dragon's breath attacks. However, due to the eight years that had passed since his death, Kamish's power was a mere fraction of what it once was, and he was ultimately released by Jin-Woo. Had he been extracted at his peak, Kamish would have undoubtedly been one of the most powerful shadows in the legion.

5. Tusk: The High Orc Shaman

The formidable High Orc Shaman, Tusk, serves as the primary magical powerhouse of the shadow army. A master of powerful spells, including gravity magic and devastating fireballs, Tusk can decimate entire armies from a distance. His intelligence and tactical acumen make him a valuable leader for the magic-wielding contingent of the shadow army. While not a frontline brawler on the level of the top three, his destructive magical capabilities are a crucial component of Jin-Woo's military might.

6. Greed: The S-Rank Hunter's Shadow

The shadow of the S-Rank hunter Hwang Dong-Su, Greed, is a testament to Jin-Woo's ability to turn even his most hated enemies into loyal soldiers. Possessing the skills and strength of an S-Rank hunter, Greed is a formidable close-quarters combatant. While he doesn't possess the overwhelming special abilities of the higher-ranked shadows, his raw physical power and combat experience make him a significant threat on the battlefield.
