System 14: The In-Game Economy - UI/UX Specifications

Design Philosophy: The presentation of wealth and rewards must feel as premium and immersive as the rest of the experience. We will avoid static, spreadsheet-like tables and instead use fluid animations and contextual displays to make earning and spending money feel satisfying and diegetic.

1. The Post-Raid Rewards UI: "The Spoils of War"

This sequence triggers automatically in the "Aftermath" scene (System 11) after the post-combat dialogue concludes.

UX Flow & Animation:

Gold Reward: Golden, shimmering motes of light stream from the location of the final defeated enemy. They fly across the screen and absorb into the player's conceptual position (bottom-center of the screen). As they absorb, a minimalist text counter appears, glows, and then gracefully fades out after 2-3 seconds.
Text Example: + ₩2,500,000
Resource Rewards: Immediately following the Gold, large, high-quality icons of the valuable resources earned (e.g., Mana Crystal, Monster Core) appear in the center of the screen. They hover for a moment, then shrink and fly towards the top-right corner, visually indicating they've been added to the player's inventory/system. A small counter (x3) appears next to the icon as it flies.
UI Specs:

Icons: Resources must have distinct, high-quality icons that look valuable (e.g., a sharp, glowing blue crystal; a dark, pulsating organic core).
Font: All text counters use the established UI font, rendered in a golden-yellow color.
2. The Quest Completion Notification: "The Wire Transfer"

This appears anywhere in the world upon completing a quest for the Hunter's Association.

UX Flow & Animation:

A sleek panel slides down smoothly from the top of the screen, pausing in the upper-third. It remains for 3-4 seconds before automatically sliding back up. It does not require user dismissal.
UI Specs:

Panel Style: A liquid glassmorphism panel, consistent with our established aesthetic. It will have the Hunter Association's logo subtly watermarked in the background.
Content Layout:
Header: TRANSACTION COMPLETE (in a bold, clean font).
Icon: A glowing Won symbol (₩) or a checkmark (✓).
Body Text: The amount, displayed prominently (e.g., ₩25,000,000).
Footer Text: A smaller line for context ("Source: Korean Hunter's Association").
3. The Vendor Interface: "The Hunter Market"

This UI appears after traveling to the Hunter Market and engaging a specific vendor NPC.

UX Flow:

Tapping a vendor opens the dialogue UI with a special, glowing "Trade" button.
Tapping "Trade" transitions the dialogue panel into a full-screen, two-paned vendor interface.
UI Specs:

Layout: A clean, two-column layout.
Left Column (Your Inventory): A scrollable list of only your sellable items. Each list item contains the item's icon, name, quantity you own (x5), and individual sell price (₩5,000,000 ea.).
Right Column (Sell List): Initially empty. Tapping items on the left adds them to this list. The user can adjust the quantity to sell.
Footer: A summary panel at the bottom shows the "Total Sale Value" which updates in real-time. A large, prominent "Confirm Sale" button finalizes the transaction.
Style: The entire interface, including the item lists and buttons, adheres to the liquid glassmorphism style.
4. The Currency Display: Contextual & Discreet

We will not have a persistent Gold counter on the screen at all times.

UI Element: A simple, elegant text element in the top-right corner of the screen.
Example: ₩ 2,458,910,330
Display Logic: This element is only visible when the user is in a view where money is directly relevant:
Inside any vendor or shop interface (Hunter Market, Realtor, etc.).
When viewing their inventory through the Monarch's Aura.
It is never visible during the main Spatial View, dialogue, or cutscenes, ensuring maximum immersion.
