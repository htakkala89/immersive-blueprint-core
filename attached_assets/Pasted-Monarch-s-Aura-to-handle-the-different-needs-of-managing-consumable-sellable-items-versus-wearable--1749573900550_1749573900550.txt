Monarch's Aura, to handle the different needs of managing consumable/sellable items versus wearable gear.

Here is the complete, detailed breakdown for both systems.

Part 1: The Inventory System

Design Philosophy: The inventory is the player's personal stash. It must be clean, highly organized, and visually appealing, allowing the player to quickly find what they need without friction. It is a functional tool wrapped in our premium aesthetic.

Access: The player opens the Monarch's Aura (System 3) and selects the 'Inventory' rune (the gem icon).
UI/UX Specifications: The Inventory Screen

This opens a full-screen UI panel using our liquid glassmorphism style.

Layout: A classic and effective three-column layout is recommended for clarity.

Column 1 (Filters): A vertical list of filter tabs to keep the inventory organized.
Column 2 (Item Grid): The main view showing the items themselves.
Column 3 (Item Details): An initially empty pane that populates when an item is selected.
Filter Tabs (Column 1):

All Items
Consumables (Potions, Elixirs, Buff items)
Valuable Resources (Mana Crystals, Monster Cores for selling)
Quest Items
Gifts (Items purchased from the department store for Cha Hae-In)
The Item Grid (Column 2):

A clean grid of squares. Each square displays a high-quality icon for the item and a number in the corner indicating the quantity (x99).
The Item Details Panel (Column 3):

When the user taps an item from the grid, this pane populates with:
A large, detailed view of the item (a high-res icon or a simple 3D model).
Item Name: "High-Grade Mana Potion"
Item Type: "Consumable"
Description: Flavor text (e.g., "A potent elixir that rapidly replenishes one's mana reserves.").
Effect: A clear description of its function (e.g., "Restores 1000 MP over 5 seconds.").
Sell Value: The price it can be sold for at a vendor (₩ 50,000).
Action Buttons: Contextual buttons like [Use], [Discard], or [Register to Hotkey] (if we implement a potion hotkey in the raid UI).
Part 2: The Equipment System (System 12: The Monarch's Armory)

Design Philosophy: Equipping gear should be a cinematic, tactile experience that emphasizes the power and prestige of the artifacts you've earned. This is not a simple "paper doll" screen; it is your personal armory.

Access: The player opens the Monarch's Aura (System 3) → Selects the 'Character' rune → Taps the "View Armory" button. This experience is built in the Unity Engine for full 3D interactivity.
UI/UX Specifications: The Armory Scene

Environment: A dark, ethereal "shadow dimension." A softly lit platform is in the center, where a full, high-quality 3D model of Sung Jin-Woo stands with a confident idle animation.
Interaction (Drag-and-Drop):
Inventory Carousel: At the bottom of the screen is a horizontal, cover-flow style carousel of all equippable gear in your inventory, represented by their own 3D models.
Equipping: The player taps and drags an item model from the carousel and drops it directly onto the corresponding area of the main character model.
Visual Feedback: The drop triggers a flash of purple light and a satisfying sound effect. The gear on the 3D model instantly updates to the new item. Any changes to Core Stats animate on screen as glowing text before fading.
The "Shadow Forge" (Upgrading):
Tapping any equipped item and selecting "Upgrade" transitions to this view. The item floats in the center of the screen. The user drags required materials from a small inventory panel onto the item to "feed" it, culminating in a dramatic upgrade animation.
The Relationship Hook:
To be clear: This screen is for managing your own gear. Gifting equipment to Cha Hae-In is a narrative action handled through the "Give a Gift" activity in the Daily Life Hub (System 4) to maintain the focus on relationship building.
