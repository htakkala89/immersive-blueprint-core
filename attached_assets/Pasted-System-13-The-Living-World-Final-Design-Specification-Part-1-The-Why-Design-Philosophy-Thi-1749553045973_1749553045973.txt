System 13: The Living World - Final Design Specification

Part 1: The "Why" - Design Philosophy

This system is the ultimate physical manifestation of the player's progression. It's not about decorating; it's about visualizing the journey. The evolution from a humble apartment to a luxurious penthouse serves as a powerful, tangible narrative device that shows the player's rise in status, wealth, and the deepening of their shared life with Cha Hae-In. This system provides the primary long-term motivation for engaging in the game's core economic loop.

Part 2: The "What" - Core Mechanics

To ensure visual consistency and artistic control while still feeling dynamic, the system operates on two core mechanics:

A. Tiered Environments: The player's home progresses through 3 distinct, pre-designed visual tiers. Upgrading a tier means the entire background image for the Spatial View is permanently switched to a new, more luxurious one.
B. Dynamic Overlays ("Decals"): Smaller, individual items purchased by the player (e.g., a trophy, a lamp, a framed photo from a date) are added as individual .PNG overlays onto the current background tier. This allows for personalization without needing to re-generate the entire scene.
Part 3: The Housing Tiers - Detailed Breakdown

This section includes the narrative purpose, unlock conditions, and specific AI image generation prompts for each tier.

Consistent Style Keywords for ALL Prompts: masterpiece, best quality, sharp focus, manhwa art style, Korean webtoon aesthetic, clean lines, detailed architectural illustration, cinematic lighting, photorealistic details

Node (on the balcony door): Thought Prompt: `"Step out onto the balcony."* -> Transitions to a new Spatial View of the balcony, unlocking new conversations.
Part 4: The Acquisition Flow & UI/UX

The Trigger: Upgrades are never automatic. The player must go to the "Luxury Realtor" location on the World Map.
The Interface: Inside the Realtor's office, interacting with the vendor opens a special UI showing the available property "listings." Each listing uses the Exterior AI Image as its preview.
The Purchase: The player makes a deliberate, high-cost purchase. A satisfying confirmation UI and sound effect plays.
The World Map Update: After the purchase, the player's "Home" node on the World Map moves to the new district (if applicable) and its Location Card is permanently updated with the new title (e.g., "The Monarch's Penthouse") and new exterior image.
The Narrative Payoff: The first time the player brings Cha Hae-In to the new home, it triggers a unique, extensive conversational scene where they explore the new space together, solidifying the upgrade as a major relationship milestone.
