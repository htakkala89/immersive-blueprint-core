This is followed by a conversational scene where they analyze their performance.
UI Components & Logic: A unique "video player" UI panel.
Potential Outcomes: Provides a tangible gameplay buff: "+5% Synergy gain on the next raid." Small Affection gain based on mutual respect.
8. Clear a Low-Rank Gate
Category: Training & Hunter Life
Narrative Goal: A "casual" but productive date for two S-Rank Hunters. It's a way to earn money and XP while spending time together.
User Experience Flow:
Player selects this card.
A simple UI modal appears: "Select a target gate:" with options like [D-Rank Goblin Den] or [C-Rank Orc Encampment].
Selecting an option immediately launches a Dungeon Raid (System 11) instance.

9. Assemble New Furniture
Category: Home Life
Narrative Goal: A humorous, relatable "couple's challenge" that generates a unique memory about building their home.
User Experience Flow:
This is a one-time activity that appears after a new piece of furniture is purchased (System 13).
Selecting it starts a conversational scene in the apartment with a large, flat-packed box on the floor.
The scene is a humorous dialogue with choices and passive Intelligence stat checks. (e.g., Player is prompted: "Should we read the instructions or just wing it?").
UI Components & Logic: Uses the core Dialogue System. The system performs a background stat check to influence flavor text.
Potential Outcomes: The furniture is always successfully built, but the dialogue creates a unique, funny Memory Star (System 6). Provides a Fun/Humorous Affection gain.
10. Give a Back Rub
Category: Intimate
Narrative Goal: A moment of gentle, non-sexual physical intimacy and care, designed to build trust and show affection through action.

UI Components & Logic: Uses the core Dialogue UI. The AI responses are highly sensitive to the player's choices. A gentle, caring approach yields the best results.
Potential Outcomes: A significant Affection gain. A boost to her "Prevailing Mood." High chance of an "Affection Heart" trigger.
