Step 1: Change the Background to a Spatial View

This is the most important change.

The Current State: The background is a generic blur.
The Fix: Replace the background entirely with a high-quality, atmospheric image of the store's interior. Imagine a sleek, modern boutique with beautiful lighting. On one side, there are glass display cases with jewelry. On the other, elegant mannequins are wearing designer clothes. This image should have a sense of depth and place. This immediately makes the user feel like they have arrived somewhere.
Step 2: Make the Items Part of the Scene

Instead of floating abstract cards, the items for sale should be visible within the store environment.

The Current State: Abstract, labeled rectangles floating in space.
The Fix: We will use our established interactive node system.
In the new background image, find the "Designer Evening Dress" on a mannequin. Place one of our glowing purple dots directly on it.
Find the "Starlight Sapphire Necklace" inside its glass display case in the background. Place another glowing purple dot on that.
Do this for 3-5 featured items in the scene. The floating rectangles with text are now removed entirely.
Step 3: Redefine the User Interaction Flow

This new design creates a much more engaging "browse and discover" experience.

Arrival: The user enters the "Luxury Department Store" and is presented with the beautiful Spatial View of the boutique interior.
Browse: They can pan the view slightly. Their eyes are drawn to the glowing purple dots on the items displayed in the scene.
Selection: Their curiosity is piqued. They tap the purple dot on the "Starlight Sapphire Necklace" glistening in its case.
Inspection: Tapping the dot triggers the main event: the "Item Inspection View" opens.
Step 4: Design the "Item Inspection View"

This is the pop-up modal that appears after tapping an item. This is where the information from your current mockup will live.

The Panel: A large liquid glassmorphism panel animates into the center of the screen, blurring the store background behind it.
Layout (Two-Column):
Left Side (The Showcase): This area is dedicated to a large, beautiful, and interactive 3D model of the necklace. The user can rotate it and see it from all angles.
Right Side (The Details): This is where you put the text information.
Item Name: "Starlight Sapphire Necklace"
Description: "A brilliant-cut sapphire said to hold the light of a captured star..."
Effect: "A special gift. Greatly increases affection."
Price: â‚© 45,000,000
Action Button: A prominent "Purchase" button.
