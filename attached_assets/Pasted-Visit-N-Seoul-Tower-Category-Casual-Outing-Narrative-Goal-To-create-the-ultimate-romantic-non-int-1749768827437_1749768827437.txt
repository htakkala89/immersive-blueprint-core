Visit N Seoul Tower
Category: Casual Outing
Narrative Goal: To create the ultimate romantic, non-intimate "milestone" date. A classic, picturesque moment for a serious couple.
User Experience Flow:
Player selects this card, which is only unlocked at a high affection level.
The game transitions to the N Seoul Tower Observation Deck Spatial View. The view is of Seoul at night.
The experience is driven by interacting with the Labeled Nodes. Tapping [●] Admire the View triggers a "cinematic mode" with special music and dialogue.
The key interaction is the [●] The Wall of Locks node, which triggers a unique scene.
UI Components & Logic: Uses the core Dialogue System and Node interactions. The "Wall of Locks" interaction requires a Padlock item (purchasable from a store) to be in the player's inventory.
