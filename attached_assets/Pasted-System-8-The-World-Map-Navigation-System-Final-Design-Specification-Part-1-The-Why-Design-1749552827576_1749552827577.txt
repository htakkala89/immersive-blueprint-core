System 8: The World Map & Navigation System - Final Design Specification

Part 1: The "Why" - Design Philosophy

Travel within the game is not a simple menu selection; it is a strategic and narrative choice. The World Map is designed as the "Monarch's Seoul," a personal, ethereal projection of the city viewed from a private sanctum. This framing reinforces the player's power and provides at-a-glance strategic information (Where is Cha Hae-In? Where are my quests?), empowering them to make intentional decisions about where to go and why. Every journey should feel purposeful.

Part 2: The "What" - Core Components & UI/UX

This section details every visual and interactive element of the map system.

A. The Main View: "Monarch's Seoul"

Access: The World Map is accessed exclusively by opening the Monarch's Aura (System 3) and selecting the 'World Map' rune.
Environment: Upon selection, the screen transitions to a full-screen view. The background is a dark, atmospheric, out-of-focus illustration of a grand hall or "Monarch's Sanctum," reinforcing the idea that the player is viewing a magical projection.
Header Panel: A liquid glassmorphism panel in the top-left contains:
Title: "Monarch's Seoul"
Context: The current in-game time of day (e.g., Afternoon) and a descriptor (Ethereal Projection).
Controls: A simple [+] and [-] for zoom in the bottom-right. An [X] in the top-right to close and return to the previous Spatial View.
B. The Map Layout: Zoned Panels

Visuals: Instead of a single flat map, the city is broken into several distinct, floating "zone" panels representing different districts (e.g., Gangnam, Hongdae). These panels have a dark, semi-transparent liquid glassmorphism style.
Interaction (On-Focus Labels):
By default, the location nodes inside the panels are unlabeled to maintain a clean, mysterious aesthetic.
When the player's cursor (on PC) or finger hovers over or taps a zone panel, that panel glows brighter and drifts slightly forward. The text labels for all location nodes within that panel then gracefully fade into view.
Moving focus away from the panel fades the labels out. This interaction model keeps the interface clean while making information readily available.
C. The Location Node: The Points of Interest

Visuals: Each location is represented by a glowing orb of light. Its appearance changes dynamically to provide crucial information.
State	Visual Cue	Meaning & Purpose
Default	A gently pulsing purple orb.	A known, accessible location.
Presence	A soft, warm golden aura pulses around the orb.	Cha Hae-In is currently at this location. This is a key navigational guide for the player.
Quest	A sharp, golden exclamation point rune (!) appears next to the orb.	An active quest objective is located here.
Locked	The orb is dim, grayed-out, and has a clear padlock icon (ðŸ”’) over it.	The location is not yet accessible. Tapping it will show the unlock condition.
Gate	A swirling, colored vortex icon. The color indicates the rank (e.g., Red for A-Rank).	A temporary dungeon entrance for combat (System 11).

D. The Location Card: The Confirmation Panel

Trigger: Appears with a smooth animation when any unlocked node is tapped.
Visuals: A large liquid glassmorphism panel that appears in the center of the screen, blurring the map behind it.
Content (in order):
Preview Image: A large, beautiful, high-quality image of the location's actual Spatial View art.
Title: The Location Name (e.g., "Luxury Department Store").
Description: A short, evocative description.
Dynamic Atmosphere: A line of text describing the current mood (e.g., "Current Atmosphere: Bustling with shoppers").
Presence Status: A clear text line: "Cha Hae-In is here" or "Cha Hae-In is not here."
Action Button: A single, prominent "Travel" button.
Part 3: The "How" - Logic and System Integration

Progression: New locations and higher-rank Gates are unlocked primarily through Story Progression and achieving Relationship Milestones with Cha Hae-In. The player does not discover locations by exploration, but by narrative entitlement.
Dynamic Data: The system must constantly update the state of all nodes in real-time. Cha Hae-In's location (the golden aura) will move from node to node throughout the day based on her schedule, making the map a living, breathing guide to the world.
The Travel Transition: Tapping the "Travel" button initiates a fast, cinematic transition (~1.5 - 2 seconds), such as the "Shadow Dash" effect or a zoom into the preview image, which completely masks the loading of the new Spatial View (System 1).
System Hub: This system is the central connective tissue. It is accessed by System 3 (Monarch's Aura) and leads the player to all other major systems and locations: narrative scenes (System 2), stores (System 7), dungeons (System 11), and their home (System 13).
