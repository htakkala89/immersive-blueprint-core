Design Philosophy: The logic is designed to simulate realistic communication with a busy, high-ranking Hunter. Her response time and tone should reflect her current situation in the game world, making the system feel grounded and believable. The goal is to create a sense of persistent connection, even when you are apart.

1. Player Sending Privileges (When You Can Send)

General Rule: The player can open the Communicator and send a message to Cha Hae-In at almost any time. This reinforces the feeling of a personal device always at hand.
Exceptions (Sending Disabled): The ability to send a message will be temporarily disabled in a few key situations to enhance narrative tension:
During a Live Conversation: If you are actively in a face-to-face dialogue scene with Cha Hae-In, you cannot simultaneously text her. The Communicator will be inaccessible.
During "No Signal" Events: For certain deep dungeons or story moments where you are cut off from the outside world, the Communicator will display a "No Signal" status, and sending will be impossible.
2. The Message State Machine (For Your Sent Messages)

To add realism, messages you send will have clear states, indicated by small icons next to the timestamp.

State 1: Sent

Icon: A single grey checkmark (✓).
Meaning: Your message has been sent from your device and is on the network. This is the immediate state after you hit send.
State 2: Delivered

Icon: A double grey checkmark (✓✓).
Meaning: The message has been delivered to Cha Hae-In's Communicator. This will happen almost instantly, unless she is in a "No Signal" area (like a dungeon).
State 3: Read

Icon: The double checkmark turns a bright, glowing purple (✓✓).
Meaning: She has opened the app and seen your message. This is a crucial step—she might read a message long before she has a moment to reply.
3. AI Response Logic (Her Reply Cadence)

This is the core logic that makes the system feel real. Cha Hae-In's reply time is not random. It is determined by a priority-based ruleset that checks her status in the game world.

Rule #1: Context is King. The AI first checks her character_state from the main game logic.

If State is Busy (e.g., "in_a_rank_raid", "in_meeting_with_association"): Her reply delay will be long. She will "Read" the message, but a reply might not come for several in-game hours.
If State is Available (e.g., "at_home_relaxing", "on_a_day_off"): Her reply delay will be short, often within minutes.
If State is Sleeping: She will not reply until the next "Morning" phase begins. The message will remain "Delivered" but not "Read" until she "wakes up."
Rule #2: Urgency Matters. The AI will do a quick analysis of your message content.

If your message contains urgent keywords ("help," "emergency," "are you okay?"), it will override her "Busy" state and trigger a much faster reply.
If your message is casual ("hey," "what's up"), it will be handled with standard priority based on her current state.
4. System & Narrative Integration

This messaging system is deeply integrated with all our other systems.

Affection (System 6): Simple, thoughtful messages ("Just thinking of you. Be safe.") provide small but consistent affection boosts. Pestering her with dozens of messages while she is clearly busy in a raid might result in a neutral or even slightly negative reaction in her eventual reply.
Activities (System 4): The player can propose activities via text.
Player: "Work at the Guild has been crazy. Want to go to Hangang Park this evening to unwind?"
Her AI Response (if she's free and agrees): "That sounds perfect. Let's do it. See you there at 7?"
Result: This conversation will then automatically create a new, scheduled activity card in the Daily Life Hub.
Quests: When the Hunter Association sends a quest via the "System Alerts" tab, the player must [Accept] it here. Accepting it will trigger the quest flag and place the ! marker on the World Map (System 8).
This logic ensures that the Communicator is not just a simple chat window, but a dynamic and meaningful part of the player's ongoing life and relationship with the world and its characters.
