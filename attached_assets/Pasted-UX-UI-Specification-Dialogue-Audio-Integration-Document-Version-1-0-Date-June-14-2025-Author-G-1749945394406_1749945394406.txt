Project: Monarch's Shadow

1.0 Overview & Core Principles

The primary goal of integrating audio is to deepen the player's emotional connection to Cha Hae-In. The audio must enhance the narrative and emotional weight of System 2 (Character Interaction & Dialogue System) without disrupting gameplay flow or player agency.

Emotional Enhancement: Voice acting should amplify the emotions conveyed in the text, from subtle shifts in tone to moments of high emotional impact.
Seamless Experience: The transition into and out of audio-driven dialogue should be seamless. The UI must be intuitive, providing control without being intrusive.
Handling the "Internal Monologue": The UX must elegantly differentiate between spoken dialogue (which will have audio) and Cha Hae-In's internal thoughts (which will remain text-only) to preserve its unique narrative function.
2.0 UX Flow & Player Experience

This section details the player's journey through an audio-enabled conversation.

2.1. Dialogue Pacing and Control

The system must balance immersion with player control, accommodating different reading speeds.

Default Behavior (Autoplay On):
Player initiates a conversation or a beat triggers one.
The dialogue box appears with Cha Hae-In's portrait and the first line of text.
Simultaneously, the corresponding audio line begins to play automatically.
An audio indicator (see UI section 3.2) is active while the voice line plays.
Once the audio clip finishes, a "Continue" prompt (see UI section 3.3) appears, signaling the player can click to advance to the next line.
Player Interruption (Advancing Early):
If the player clicks while an audio line is still playing, the current audio will gracefully fade out over ~0.5 seconds (not abruptly cut off).
The dialogue immediately advances to the next line, and the next audio clip begins. This respects the player's pace while minimizing jarring audio cuts.
Skipping Dialogue:
A "Skip" button will be present but unobtrusive (e.g., in the top-right corner of the dialogue UI).
Pressing "Skip" will fast-forward through all beats of the current conversation, stopping at the next player dialogue choice or the end of the scene. It will not skip major cinematic events.
2.2. The "Internal Monologue" UX Flow

This is crucial for maintaining the narrative integrity of System 2.

Spoken Line: Cha Hae-In's spoken dialogue appears, and her voice audio plays as described above.
Example Text: That was a tough fight. You were incredible. (Audio plays)
Player clicks to continue.
Internal Thought: The next screen displays her internal thought. This text has no audio. It appears instantly and silently, creating a sense of intimacy and privacy. The pacing feels like she spoke, and then the player gets a privileged glimpse into her mind.
Example Text: (*My heart was pounding the entire time. I was so scared of losing him.*) (No audio, text only).
Player clicks to continue to the next line of spoken dialogue or the player's response prompt.
This sequence ensures the audio enhances the external persona while the silent text preserves the intimacy of her inner world.

3.0 UI Components & Visual Design

The following UI elements should be integrated into the existing System 1 (Spatial View Interface) when dialogue is active.

3.1. Dialogue Box Enhancement

Speaker Portrait: A high-fidelity, expressive portrait of Cha Hae-In will be displayed next to her dialogue text.
Text Differentiation:
Spoken Text: Standard, highly legible font.
Internal Monologue Text: The same font but italicized and enclosed in the established (*...*) format to visually distinguish it from spoken words.
3.2. Audio State Indicator

Icon: A small, clean "sound wave" or "speaker" icon placed near the speaker's portrait.
States:
Playing: The icon animates subtly (e.g., waves pulsing outwards).
Finished/Idle: The icon is static.
Disabled/Muted: The icon is static and greyed out or has a slash through it.
3.3. Interaction Prompts

Continue Prompt: A gently flashing arrow or pulsating dot appears in the bottom-right corner of the dialogue box only after the audio line has finished playing. If the player clicks early, this prompt appears on the next line once its audio finishes.
Dialogue Choice UI: Unchanged, but selecting a choice will trigger Cha Hae-In's audio-enabled response.
4.0 Settings & Accessibility

These options should be housed within a dedicated "Audio" tab in the main settings menu.

Volume Sliders (0-100):
Master Volume
Music Volume
SFX Volume
Dialogue Volume: A new, dedicated slider to allow players to balance voice levels against other game sounds.
Dialogue Autoplay (Toggle):
On (Default): Audio plays automatically when a dialogue line appears.
Off: The player must click to play the audio for each line. The audio indicator will show a "play" icon until clicked.
Subtitles (Toggle):
On (Default): All spoken dialogue is accompanied by text. The text will match the audio verbatim.
Off: Dialogue text is hidden. The player relies solely on the voice audio. (Internal Monologues will still be displayed as they are text-only).
5.0 System Integration

System 2 (Character Interaction & Dialogue System): The data structure for each dialogue entry must be expanded to include:
audio_file_path: string (e.g., "audio/ep01/cha_hae_in_001.wav")
is_internal_monologue: boolean (to determine if audio should be played)
System 10 (Technical Architecture & UX): The engine must be optimized to preload/stream upcoming audio files during conversations to prevent lag or buffering, ensuring a seamless experience.
System 18 (Episodic Story Engine): No changes are required to System 18's design, as it only triggers actions in System 2. The new audio functionality will be handled entirely within System 2.
