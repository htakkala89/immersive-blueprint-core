Let's apply some detailed formatting rules to the text to elevate it to a premium, cinematic level.

1. Distinguishing Actions from Dialogue
The biggest improvement we can make is to visually separate a character's actions from their spoken words.

Current State: Actions are mixed in with dialogue using asterisks (e.g., "Oh, Hunter Sung Jin-Woo. *A small...smile touches her lips*"). This can be clunky to read.
The Fix: Actions should be on their own line and styled differently. They should be italicized and have a slightly lower opacity or a different color to feel like stage directions in a script.
Example:

*A small, almost imperceptible smile touches her lips.

"Oh, Hunter Sung Jin-Woo. I..."

This immediately makes the text cleaner and easier to parse.

2. Improving Typography and Readability
Small changes here make a huge difference in the premium feel.

Line Spacing (Leading): We need more space between the lines of text. This is crucial for readability. I would recommend increasing the line-height to around 1.5. This gives the text room to breathe.
Font Weight: Her main dialogue should be a clean, standard weight (e.g., font-weight: 400 or 500). The player's line and her actions/internal thoughts should be a slightly lighter weight or italicized to create a clear visual hierarchy.
Color Contrast: Her dialogue text should be a bright, crisp white or very light lavender to be easily readable. The player's text and her actions can be a slightly dimmer off-white or light grey.
The Fully Formatted "Scene Script"
Here is how the text from your mockup would look after applying all of these design principles. This is the final vision for how all dialogue should be formatted.

(Your line appears first, right-aligned):

Just wanted to see you.

(Her response appears on the left, formatted like this):

*She looks up from her work, her eyes meeting yours. A small, almost imperceptible smile touches her lips for just a moment before she regains her composure.



"Oh, Hunter Sung Jin-Woo."


(*My heart is pounding. He's said that before, but...here? In the Hunter Association?*)


"Such compliments are... unnecessary in this setting. We are reviewing mission reports."


(*But...it feels nice.*)

This formatting is clean, cinematic, and easy to follow. It clearly separates her actions, her spoken words, and her private internal thoughts, creating the deep, multi-layered conversational experience we've been aiming for.
