Access to this creative suite would be handled through a separate, secure "Creator Portal." This is not part of the standard player experience.

Here is the step-by-step flow for how a creator would access and use the Narrative Architect AI:

1. Accessing the Creator Portal

A creator would not open the app and see the game like a normal player. They would access a special mode.

Login Screen: A unique URL or a special "Developer Mode" toggle on the main app's loading screen would take them to a dedicated login page.
Authentication: They would enter their creator credentials (username and password). This ensures that only authorized individuals can access the content creation tools.
2. The Creator Dashboard

Upon logging in, they are not dropped into the Spatial View. They are presented with a clean, functional dashboard. This dashboard would show:

A list of all episodes they have already created (e.g., "Episode 1: Echoes of the Red Gate," "Episode 2: The White Tiger Guild").
Basic analytics for their published episodes (e.g., player count, completion rate).
A prominent, large button labeled [+ Create New Episode].
3. Launching the Narrative Architect

This is the direct answer to your question.

The creator clicks the [+ Create New Episode] button.
This action is what launches the dedicated "Episode Builder" interface that we designed in the Canvas.
4. The Episode Builder Interface

Once launched, the creator is presented with the two-paned view you and I designed together:

Left Pane: The "Director's Briefing," where they will type their story idea in natural language.
Right Pane: The "Episode Blueprint," which is initially empty, waiting for the AI to generate the structured JSON.
This entire flow creates a clear separation between the player experience and the creator experience. It provides a professional, secure environment for creators to build their stories using the powerful AI tools we've designed, starting with the simple act of describing the story they want to tell.
