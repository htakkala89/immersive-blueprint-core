Episode Implementation GuideTo: Lead Engineer & Content Creation TeamFrom: Design TeamSubject: Technical specifications and event flow for implementing story episodes.OverviewThis document outlines the state changes, event triggers, and system calls required to implement any story episode. The entire questline is managed by System 18 (The Episodic Story Engine), which reads a master "Episode" file (in a format like JSON) and executes commands based on player actions.The core data structure for any episode will be an object containing an array of "Story Beats." The engine will act as a state machine, progressing from one beat to the next as completion_condition events are met. What follows is the technical breakdown using "Episode 1: Echoes of the Red Gate" as a concrete example.Beat 1.0: The Ominous DiscoveryObjective: To introduce the quest to the player in an immersive way after they meet the prerequisites.Prerequisite Check: The Story Engine will have a persistent background task that checks if player.level >= 25 and player.relationship.level >= 4. This check should run upon application start and after every level-up or major relationship event.Trigger: The prerequisite check returns true.Engine Commands (actions array):DELIVER_MESSAGE(system_15, 'Hunter Association', 'EP01_Alert_Message')Implementation: Call the Communicator (System 15) manager. Push a new message object to the "System Alerts" tab. The message content is pulled from a localization file using the ID EP01_Alert_Message. The UI should trigger the slide-down notification banner.ACTIVATE_QUEST('EP01_Red_Echo', 'Investigate the A-Rank Gate Alert.')Implementation: Add a new quest object to the player's active_quests array in their data profile. This object will contain the quest ID, title, and an empty list for objectives. The Quest Log (System 3) UI will read from this array to populate its "Active Missions" list. Add a [Begin Investigation] button to the quest card in the UI.Completion Condition: player_accepts_episode('EP01_Red_Echo')Implementation: The engine listens for a specific UI event triggered by the player tapping the [Begin Investigation] button in the Quest Log.Beat 1.1: A Partner's FearObjective: To force a critical, emotional conversation with Cha Hae-In that sets the personal stakes for the episode.Trigger: The player_accepts_episode event from the previous beat is fired.Engine Commands (actions array):SET_CHA_MOOD('Anxious')Implementation: Update the global character state object for Cha Hae-In. Set cha_hae_in.current_mood = "Anxious". This state variable will be passed to the AI Narrative Engine (System 9) in all subsequent API calls for this beat.FORCE_CHA_LOCATION('Hunter Association HQ')Implementation: This command creates a temporary override in the Character Presence Logic (System 8). The logic engine will now ignore the default time-of-day schedule and always return "Hunter Association HQ" as her location until this override is cleared. The World Map UI should update to show her golden presence aura at the HQ node.START_DIALOGUE_SCENE('EP01_Anxious_Convo')Implementation: This is a high-priority command. The game should check if the player is at the Hunter Association HQ. If not, the current quest objective is updated to "Meet Cha Hae-In at the Hunter Association HQ." If the player is at the location, the game immediately initiates a conversation. The Dialogue System (System 2) will load a specific dialogue file (EP01_Anxious_Convo.json) that contains her pre-scripted internal monologue and the specific branching "empathetic" vs. "professional" dialogue choices.Completion Condition: dialogue_scene_complete('EP01_Anxious_Convo')Implementation: The Dialogue System fires a completion event when the player reaches the end of any branch in the specified dialogue file.Beat 1.2: The Dungeon ObjectiveObjective: To clearly direct the player to the main gameplay section.Trigger: The dialogue_scene_complete event from the previous beat is fired.Engine Commands (actions array):SET_QUEST_OBJECTIVE('EP01_Red_Echo', 'Enter the Red Echo Gate with Cha Hae-In.')Implementation: Update the EP01_Red_Echo quest object in the player's profile with this new objective text.SPAWN_LOCATION(system_8, 'dungeon_red_echo', 'A-Rank')Implementation: Add a new, temporary location node to the World Map (System 8) data model for the duration of this quest. The node should have the A-Rank Gate visual state.Completion Condition: player_enters_dungeon('dungeon_red_echo')Implementation: The engine listens for the event fired when the player travels to the gate and confirms entry, which triggers the transition to the Unity Engine (System 11).Beat 1.3: The Boss Confrontation & AftermathObjective: To provide the emotional and narrative climax of the episode.Trigger: The Unity scene fires a boss_defeated('High_Elf_Archmage_Phantom') event back to the native iOS shell.Engine Commands (actions array):REMOVE_CHA_LOCATION_OVERRIDE()Implementation: Clears the forced location flag. Her location logic will revert to the standard time-of-day schedule after this scene.SET_CHA_MOOD('Relieved', 'Vulnerable')Implementation: Updates her global character state object for the upcoming conversation.START_DIALOGUE_SCENE('EP01_Aftermath_Convo')Implementation: The native shell loads the post-battle Spatial View (the quiet boss room) and immediately initiates the final, heartfelt dialogue scene.COMPLETE_QUEST('EP01_Red_Echo')Implementation: Moves the quest object from the active_quests array to the completed_quests array in the player's profile.REWARD_PLAYER('Gold:50000000', 'Item:Shadow_Elf_Dagger')Implementation: Call the manager for the Economy System (System 14) to add the specified amount of Gold. Call the inventory manager to add the specified item to the player's inventory. Trigger the reward UI animations.CREATE_MEMORY_STAR(...)Implementation: Create a new memory object and add it to the player's relationship_memories array. The Relationship Constellation (System 6) UI reads from this array to render the stars.UNLOCK_ACTIVITY(...)Implementation: Add the specified activity ID to the player's unlocked_activities list. The Daily Life Hub (System 4) checks this list to determine which activity cards to display.Completion Condition: dialogue_scene_complete('EP01_Aftermath_Convo')Implementation: After the final line of dialogue, the episode is considered complete. A final "Episode Complete" banner can be displayed.
