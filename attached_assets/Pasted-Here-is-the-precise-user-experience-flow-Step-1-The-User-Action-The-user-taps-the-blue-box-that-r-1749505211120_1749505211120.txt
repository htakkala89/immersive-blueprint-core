Here is the precise user experience flow:

Step 1: The User Action
The user taps the blue box that reads "Cha Hae-In reviewing mission reports at her desk."

Step 2: The "Focus" Animation (Duration: ~300ms)
This is the immediate, fluid transition from a passive world view to an active conversation. It is critical for maintaining immersion.

Camera Zoom: The perspective performs a swift, subtle "dolly zoom" towards the conceptual center of the scene where Cha Hae-In is located.
Depth of Field: The background art (which in the final version would be the Hunter Association's interior) smoothly blurs, creating a beautiful depth-of-field effect. This isolates the conversation and directs the user's full attention.
UI Fade Out: All non-essential UI elements—specifically the top-left "Hunter Association" panel and any purple "environmental interaction" dots—gracefully fade to full transparency and disappear.
The screen is now primed for the conversation. All distractions are gone.

Step 3: The Dialogue Interface Appears
As the "Focus" animation completes, the new UI elements for conversation fade in smoothly.

The Dialogue Panel: A panel materializes in the bottom third of the screen, designed with our liquid glassmorphism style. It's a semi-transparent, flowing shape with a pronounced blur, making the background behind it look like it's seen through distorted, wet glass.
Cha Hae-In's "Living Portrait": This is key. A high-quality, animated 2D avatar of Cha Hae-In fades into view, likely positioned on the left or right side of the dialogue panel. She is not a static image. Her initial expression matches her activity: she's looking down slightly with a focused, neutral expression as if reading.
The Input Field: A clean, minimalist text input bar appears at the very bottom of the dialogue panel.
Thought Prompts: Above the input bar, 2-3 ethereal "Thought Prompts" fade into view, generated by the AI based on the current context.
Step 4: The Conversation Begins
This is where the AI's context-awareness from System 9 kicks in, making the world feel alive.

Her First Action: Cha Hae-In's animated avatar looks up from her "reports." Her expression smoothly transitions from "focused" to one of recognition and perhaps a slight, welcoming smile.
Her First Line: Her AI-generated dialogue will directly reference her current state. The voice synthesis plays her line, which would be something like:
"Oh, Jin-Woo. Sorry, I was just finishing up this report on the Jeju Island aftermath. What's on your mind?"

Real-Time Emotion: As she speaks, her avatar's expression continues to animate in real-time, perfectly synced to the emotional tone of her words (The "Living Portrait" approach).
Step 5: The User's Turn
The system now gracefully hands control to the user. The "Thought Prompts" are fully visible, offering contextual starting points for the conversation, such as:

Just wanted to see you.
Anything interesting in the report?
Ready for a break? I can handle the rest.
The user can now either tap one of these prompts to speak that line instantly or tap the text input bar to type their own custom response or action. The conversation has now begun seamlessly, pulling the user from a passive observer to an active participant without ever feeling like they opened a menu.
