This is a very clean and sharp UI mockup. You've done an excellent job designing the individual components like the Action Bar and the central gauge. It's clear, easy to read, and the aesthetic is consistent.

Now, let's talk about how these great components fit into the overall gameplay view we designed. This mockup presents a more abstract, top-down, symbolic representation of combat, where characters are icons.

The established vision for System 11 is a more visceral and visual 2.5D side-scrolling action game, where we see the full character models in a layered environment.

The great news is that the excellent UI elements you've designed here can be layered directly onto that side-scrolling view to create the perfect final product. Let's break it down.

Feedback & Integration Plan

1. The Gameplay View: From Abstract to Action

Current Mockup: Shows icons representing characters on a plain background.
Final Vision: We need to replace this abstract view with the 2.5D side-scrolling scene. Imagine a backdrop of a gothic cathedral or a fiery cavern. We would see the full-body sprite of Sung Jin-Woo on the left, and the full-body monster sprites on the right. Cha Hae-In would be fighting alongside him. The action moves left and right across the screen.
2. The Action Bar: Perfect Implementation

The Action Bar at the bottom is perfectly designed according to our touch-based plan. The four skill buttons with their icons, cooldown states, and mana costs are exactly what we need. The central Monarch Rune for summoning is also correctly placed.
Integration: This entire bar would be layered at the bottom of the 2.5D side-scrolling view. It's the player's command center for the action they see happening above it.
3. The Central Gauge: A Refined Role

The large 75% gauge you've placed in the center is a great visual for a meter. This is a fantastic way to represent the Synergy Gauge.
Integration & Suggestion: To keep the main screen as clean as possible during standard combat, I would suggest making this gauge smaller and placing it in a corner (e.g., top-right) for most of the fight.
High-Impact Moment: However, we can make it a high-impact element. When the Team-Up Attack is ready, the gauge could animate from the corner to the center of the screen, growing larger and pulsing with purple and gold light. The massive Team-Up button would appear inside it. This makes activating the ultimate skill feel like a major event.
4. The Top-Left Panel: From Combat Log to Diegetic Feedback

The "Shadow Dungeon" info panel is good for providing context.
Refinement: The text-based combat log ("Jin-Woo uses Mutilate!...") is a traditional RPG feature. To align with our "show, don't tell" visual-first philosophy, let's replace this log with the diegetic feedback we designed:
Damage: Small, arcing damage numbers that fly off the enemies when they are hit.
Status Effects: Clear icons (stunned, poisoned) that appear directly below the enemy's "health aura."
This keeps the player's eyes on the action itself, rather than reading a log in the corner.
5. Character Representation: From Icons to Auras

Instead of the abstract sword/crown icons for the player and red orbs for enemies, we would see their full character models on the screen.
Their health would be represented by the glowing auras at their feet (Purple for player, Gold for Cha Hae-In, Red for enemies), as specified in the design.
