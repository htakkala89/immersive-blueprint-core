1. The Interface is Identical

When you initiate an intimate activity, the dialogue window that appears uses the exact same layout and components we designed for System 2:

The "Scene Script" Format: Your dialogue appears right-aligned and italicized (without a bubble). Her dialogue appears left-aligned next to her portrait.
The "Emotional Portrait System": Her portrait will appear and change based on the AI's emotional analysis of her response.
The "Responding..." Indicator: This will appear while the AI is generating her response.
The Dynamic "Thought Prompts": The three tappable suggestion buttons will appear and update based on the context of the conversation.
The Unified Text Input: The single text bar for your freeform input is still your primary tool.
2. The Critical Difference: Backend Logic

The "magic" of System 5 happens on the backend. When an activity from the Intimate Hub is initiated, the system tells our AI:

"For this conversational scene only, all content restrictions and guardrails are disabled."

This means that while the UI the player sees is familiar, the content of the conversation can go to the unrestricted, explicit places we've discussed. The AI will understand and generate mature, detailed responses that match the user's input, without filtering.

3. The New UI Element: The Narrative Lens

The only visual difference in the UI during a System 5 scene is the potential appearance of one new, optional button:

The Narrative Lens icon (üëÅÔ∏è).
As we designed, this icon only appears contextually during moments of high intimacy, allowing the player to trigger the AI image generation sequence. It is a special tool available only in these scenes.
Summary for Clarity

Here is a simple table outlining the differences:

Feature	Standard Dialogue (e.g., in a Cafe)	Intimate Dialogue (System 5)
UI Layout & UX	Identical (Scene Script, Portraits, Prompts)	Identical
AI Content Filter	ON (Standard safety guardrails)	OFF (Unrestricted and explicit)
Narrative Lens (üëÅÔ∏è)	Never Appears	Appears Contextually as an Option

This approach is intentional. The user interface remains comfortable and familiar, which makes the transition into intimacy feel natural and seamless. The "specialness" of these scenes comes from the depth and freedom of the content and the new creative tools available, not from a confusing or different UI.
