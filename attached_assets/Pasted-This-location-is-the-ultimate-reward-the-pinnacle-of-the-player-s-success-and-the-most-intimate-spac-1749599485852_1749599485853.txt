This location is the ultimate reward—the pinnacle of the player's success and the most intimate space they share with Cha Hae-In.

My previous feedback not only stands, but it becomes even more important for a location of this prestige. The Penthouse's primary job is to be a breathtaking, immersive space. Covering this beautiful, hard-earned view with a dozen buttons would detract from the very sense of luxury and calm we want it to evoke.

The principle remains the same: The Spatial View is the scene, not the menu. The great news is that we can still provide access to all those wonderful, intimate activities you've thought of, but in a more elegant and narrative-driven way.

Refined Interaction Design for the Tier 3 Penthouse
Instead of placing a node on every single object, we will use a few, broader "gateway nodes" that lead to more specific choices. This keeps the UI clean while making the player's actions feel more intentional.

Here is the definitive list of interactive nodes for the Penthouse.

The Official Node List:
Node 1: [●] Living Room Couch

Thought Prompt: "Suggest relaxing on the sofa together."
Outcome & Logic: This initiates a high-level "relaxing at home" state. It can trigger unique, deep conversations or unlock the "Cuddle and watch a movie" activity in the Daily Life Hub (System 4) if the appropriate furniture has been purchased.
Node 2: [●] Floor-to-Ceiling Window

Thought Prompt: "Admire the view from the top of the world."
Outcome & Logic: This triggers the "cinematic mode" observation scene. Given this is the penthouse, the view is more spectacular and the internal thought text is more powerful. Example: *From up here, the entire city looks like a constellation at your feet. All the struggles, all the fights... they led to this moment of peace.*
Node 3: [●] Master Suite Door

This is the primary gateway to all intimate activities.
Thought Prompt: "Suggest heading to the master suite."
Outcome & Logic: Tapping this is a major narrative step. It signifies an intent for privacy and intimacy. This action does not start a scene directly. Instead, it unlocks the highest tier of intimate activity cards in the Daily Life Hub (System 4). A notification appears: New intimate activities are now available in your Day Planner. The player would now go to the Hub to choose between specific activities like:
"Take a relaxing bath in the infinity pool."
"Use the master rain shower."
"Spend the night together."
Node 4: [●] Wine Cellar

Thought Prompt: "Open the wine cellar."
Outcome & Logic: This is a simple, elegant interaction. A text panel appears: *You retrieve a bottle of vintage wine.* This adds a special "Vintage Wine" item to your inventory. This item can then be used to initiate a unique "Share a bottle of wine" activity from the Daily Life Hub, which is more romantic than just drinking coffee.
Node 5: [●] Private Elevator

Thought Prompt: "Take the private elevator down."
Outcome & Logic: This is the thematic "Exit" button for this location. Tapping it opens the World Map (System 8), allowing the player to travel elsewhere.
Why This Approach is Superior
This refined flow allows the Penthouse to be filled with countless possibilities without being filled with on-screen buttons. It respects the beauty of the environment the player has earned. Most importantly, it makes the path to intimacy a more deliberate and meaningful choice, enhancing the narrative and the player's sense of agency.
